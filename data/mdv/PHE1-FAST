MajoraFact
# MDV defines no ModelField (MF) or FilterField (FF) lines as
# the PHE1-FAST dataview is hardcoded as a subtask in majora2/mdv_tasks.py
# and is not configured dynamically from the database like the PHE1 view.
#
# The MDV entrypoint definition is mandatory and used to generate a
# queryset as part of the init for an MDV, but the queryset is ignored.
# As the queryset is ignored it is a waste of time to generate a long list
# of IDs of objects that is immediately discarded!
# We use MajoraFact as the entrypoint as it is the smallest queryset.
