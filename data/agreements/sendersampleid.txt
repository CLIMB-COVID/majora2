Share UK-ENG sender_sample_id with Public Health England
Shares central_sample_id and sender_sample_id for UK-ENG samples with PHE
2	2020-07-13	2020-04-06
*
I confirm that the following fields of metadata uploaded to Majora from my account can be provided to Public Health England to allow linkage to wider datasets:

    * sender_sample_id (Sample ID assigned by the sending laboratory and communnicated to SGSS)
    * central_sample_id (COG-UK sample ID)

On 2021-05-17 this agreement was unilaterally updated to additionally provide the following fields to assist in sender_sample_id disambiguation, effective 2021-05-24:

    * collection_date (Date sample was collected)
    * received_date (Date sample was received)

## Criteria

* Biosamples I have uploaded where adm1 is set to UK-ENG.
* Existing biosamples uploaded since 2020-04-06
* Future biosamples uploaded by my account where adm1 is set to UK-ENG.

## Termination

This agreement can be terminated through this interface at any time.
Terminating this agreement will stop these fields from being shared with PHE as part of future data sets.
Terminating this agreement will not 'unshare' previously shared identifiers with PHE.
